Please check back soon for updates.\nI am recent MS graduate from the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech where I was advised by Anuj Karpatne in the Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning Lab. My research is in multiobjective optimization/multitask learning of physics-guided neural networks for applications in lake ecology and water quality modeling.\nPrior to joining the MS program, I completed my Bachelor’s in Computational Modeling and Data Analytics from Virginia Tech.\nWhen I’m not working, I love to bike, travel and do photography (especially astrophotography 🌌🔭).\n\nRecent News"
