ðŸ‘· **This Page is Under Construction** ðŸš§  
Thanks for stopping by! I'm currently working on building this page. Please 
check back soon for updates.

I am recent MS graduate from the Department of Computer Science at Virginia 
Tech where I was advised by Anuj Karpatne in the Knowledge-Guided Machine 
Learning Lab. My research is in multiobjective optimization/multitask learning 
of physics-guided neural networks for applications in lake ecology and water 
quality modeling.

Prior to joining the MS program, I completed my Bachelor's in Computational 
Modeling and Data Analytics from Virginia Tech.

When I'm not working, I love to bike, travel and do photography (especially 
astrophotography ðŸŒŒðŸ”­).
